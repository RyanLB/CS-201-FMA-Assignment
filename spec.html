  <h1>Your Task</h1>
  <p>
    This assignment requires you to write a function, using inline assembly, that takes three arbitrary-length vectors of double-precision floating point numbers a, b, and c, and perform the following operation:
  </p>

  <pre>
    for(int i = 0, j = length; ++i) {
      a[i] += b[i] * c[i];
    }
  </pre>

  <p>
    The code above will calculate the correct result, but it performs slowly. Yours will need to be faster. Fortunately, we have hardware support for this; modern processors have a set of vector extensions called AVX2 that will allow us to perform calculations on up to four doubles at a time. In fact, AVX2 adds support for exactly this purpose through the use of the new FMA3 <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply–accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add'>fused multiply-add</a> instructions.
  
    <br />

    Distribution code for creating random vectors and testing the performance of your code against a naïve scalar implementation can be found at the following repo: <a href='https://github.com/RyanLB/CS-201-FMA-Assignment'>https://github.com/RyanLB/CS-201-FMA-Assignment</a>
  </p>

  <h3>What to Submit</h3>

  <p>
    Your submission should be a single file with the title <span style='font-family: monospace'>submission.c</span>. This file should contain, at minimum, a function with the following signature:
  </p>

  <pre>
    bool vectorized_fma(const struct doubleVector * a, const struct doubleVector * b, const struct doubleVector * c)
  </pre>

  <p>
    This function should work with the provided <span style='font-family: monospace'>main.c</span> and <span style='font-family: monospace'>Makefile</span>; there is no need to write or include your own. The function also should not print output to the screen or take input from the user.
    
    <br /><br />

    The return value should indicate whether or not the computation was successful. The only case that I can think of off the top of my head that would cause this to fail is if the vectors had varying lengths.
  </p>

  <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

  <p>
    Assignments will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>Your submission should use inline C and vector instructions</li>
      <li>Your submission should calculate the same result as the included scalar implementation for vector sets with arbitrary (strictly positive) lengths</li>
      <li>For a vector of length 10,000,000, your implementation should perform (at minimum) 20 times faster than the included scalar implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    The file <span style='font-family: monospace'>main.c</span> contains code that will be used to test and benchmark your submission. Running this program should give you a good idea of whether or not your code is correct.
  </p>

  <h1>Notes and Hints</h1>

  <p>
    To complete this assignment, you'll need to work on a processor that supports AVX2 instructions. I would recomment <span style='font-family: monospace'</span>linuxlab.cs.pdx.edu</span>, which is also where submissions will be tested.

    <br /><br />

    Included in the distribution code is a file called <span style='font-family: monospace'>vectors.s</span>. This file contains a couple of assembly routines which are used to copy and compare vectors of doubles. Looking at these may be helpful, as they contain usage examples of most – if not all – of the vector instructions you need.

    <br /><br />

      You may notice that the scalar implementation is also written in assembly, and uses the <span style='font-family: monospace'>vfmadd132sd</span> instruction. This is necessary because FMA instructions are <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply–accumulate_operation'>actually also more precise</a> than a separate multiplication and addition, since we only need to round once. If you're attempting to debug your code in GDB or similar by checking its results against expressions like <span style='font-family: monospace'>a->data[0] + b->data[0] * c->data[0]</span>, you may notice minute differences in the smallest decimal digits; this is why.
